--This routine is used to remove a course session. The inputs to the routine include the following: course offering identifier and session number.
--If the course session has not yet started and the request is valid, the routine will process the request with the necessary updates.
--The request must not be performed if there is at least one registration for the session.
--Note that the resultant seating capacity of the course offering could fall below the course offeringâ€™s target number of registrations, which is allowed.
